This weekend I came across a blog-post where the poster showed a "solution" to the "The ROLLBACK TRANSACTION request has no corresponding BEGIN TRANSACTION" error we sometimes see when various stored procedures call each other. The solution (even though it masked out the error in question) did not get it quite right.

Today after having browsed around a bit more I realized I had done it the hard way. To install the required bits for F# for Mac, you only have to download a zip file with an install package for Mac from the <a href="http://fsxplat.codeplex.com/">F# Cross Platform</a> site on CodePlex. The actual zip-file for the November 2010 CTP is <a href="/2010/11/19/fsharp-mono-and-mac/">here</a>.</p> <p>After you have downloaded the file you unzip it and run the <code>.pkg</code> file. This takes care of everything; no re-signing with the <code>.snk</code> file etc. The added benefit of installing from the <code>.pkg</code> file is that a couple of F# compiler dll's are automatically gac:ed (they are needed if you want to run the F# plugin for MonoDevelop), and aliases are created for the F# compiler and the F# interactive window.</p> <hr> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/2010/11/19/fsharp-mono-and-mac/"> F#, Mono and Mac </a> </h1> <div class="post-subheading"> <span class="post-date">19 Nov 2010</span> <span class="post-tag"> <span class="post-tagdesc">in categories:</span> NET Mono <span class="post-tagdesc">tags:</span> F# Mac osx </span> </div> <p>This is a first post about my experiences with running F# and Mono on a Mac.</p> <p>In a <a href="/2010/11/15/using-fsharp-in-sqlclr/">previous post</a> I wrote about how I have started to play with F#. As that post also covered SQLCLR it was obvious I was on Windows. Even though I make my living from development in a Windows environment, my main machine is a MacBook, and I run OSX as my main OS. I have previously also been running Linux (ArchLinux) on this machine as my main OS. Naturally I have heard about Mono (and also installed it a couple of times - and quickly un-installed again, but I have not really done anything with it. I have always run Windows in a VM on my MacBook for development etc. However after the announcement that F# was going <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx">Open Source</a>, and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog">Tomas P</a> <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-in-monodevelop.aspx">posted</a> about his F# MonoDevelop plug-in</a>, I decided that I should have a look at what it would be like to do F# "stuff in OSX.</p> <a href="/2010/11/19/fsharp-mono-and-mac/"><strong>Read More ...</strong></a> <hr> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page10">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page8">Newer</a> </div> </div> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-18914734-2', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
