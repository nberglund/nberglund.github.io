You want to download the zip file.</li> </ol> <p>Having downloaded what I thought was necessary (I decided to hold off with MonoDevelop until I had everything running), I started the installation process. Installing Mono was straight forward, just mount the <code>.dmg</code> and then run the <code>.pkg</code> file. The only slight issue after installation was where it had been installed. Mostly for my own reference for later installations; Mono is located at: <code>/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework</code>.</p> <p>After I had installed Mono, I copied the bin directory from the unzipped F# file to a directory I created in the same root folder as where Mono was: <code>/Library/Frameworks/FSharp</code>. I copied the <code>install-mono.sh</code> file to the FSharp directory and was ready to start the installation. Fortunately before I executed the <code>install-mono.sh</code> file, I read the comments in the file. At this stage I realised I had not downloaded everything necessary.</p> <p>One of the F# dll's <code>FSharp.Core.dll</code> needs to be installed in the gac. In order to do that, the dll needs to be re-signed with the <code>mono.snk</code> key. The installation file mentions how you can download the file using <code>wget</code>. As I did not have <code>wget</code> I found a link to it and downloaded it by right-clicking on the link and choose "Save Link As". Once again mostly for my future reference; the file can be found <a href="http://github.com/mono/mono/raw/master/mcs/class/mono.snk">here</a>, (just right click and choose "Save Link As"). I saved it into the F# root folder (the same folder where the <code>install-mono.sh</code> is).</p> <p>So, now everything should be ready to go. I executed the install file and promptly got an error saying that the <code>FSharp.Core.dll</code> could not be installed in the gac. Hmm, not good! Fortunately the error message mentioned something about a possible permission error, so I looked at the permissions on the gac folder (<code>../Mono.framework/Versions/2.8/lib/mono/gac</code>), and sure enough - I did not have write permissions. I gave myself write permissions, and re-ran the installation and everything went OK. Cool!!</p> <p>After this it was time to test it out. From the F# bin directory I ran the following from a terminal window to execute the compiler: <code>mono fsc.exe</code>. It seemed to work as I got this error back:</p> <p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/fsc.exe.png" width="658" height="178" ></p> <p>I then tried the interactive window: <code>mono fsi.exe</code>. I wrote some simple test code:</p> <p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/fsi-exec.png" width="661" height="330" ></p> <p>As you can see, that worked as well!! So I am now well on the way of running (and learning) F# on Mono. Next step is to install MonoDevelop and Tomas P's plugin for F#. Stay tuned...</p> <p> <h2>Share this Post:</h2> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://nielsberglund.com/2010/11/19/fsharp-mono-and-mac/&text=F#, Mono and Mac&via=nielsberglund" target="_blank">Twitter</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.nielsberglund.com//2010/11/19/fsharp-mono-and-mac/" onclick="javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;"> | Google+</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle? mini=true &url=http://www.nielsberglund.com/2010/11/19/fsharp-mono-and-mac/ &title=F#, Mono and Mac &summary=Blog post: &source=http://www.nielsberglund.com/2010/11/19/fsharp-mono-and-mac/"> | LinkedIn</a> </p> <!--<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=<URL>&title=<TITILE>&summary=<DESCRIPTION>&sourc https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://nielsberglund.com/2010/11/19/fsharp-mono-and-mac/ --> <p> <h2>Blog Feed:</h2> To automatically receive more posts like this, please <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/manageddata/" target="_blank"> subscribe to my RSS/Atom feed</a> in your feed reader!</p> <br/> <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <!-- Ad2 --> <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3005153158271538" data-ad-slot="1158080725" data-ad-format="auto"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); </script> <br/> </div> <div class="related"> <h2>Related Posts</h2> <div class="related-posts"> <h3><a href="/2010/11/20/fsharp-mono-and-mac-2/"> F#, Mono and Mac - Take II <small> (20 Nov 2010)</small> </a></h3> </div> </div> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script> var disqus_developer = 1; (function() { /*DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE*/ var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//manageddata.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-18914734-2', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
